  _ 2014-21-10

  !!!!PLEASE READ THIS MESSAGE!!!<br><br>
  Even though XGELS now supports Google Search 4.0 I do NOT advise sideloading it. I wasn't able to restore all of XGELS functionality due to massive changes made by Google. I've worked for the last 4 days to make it work again. Thanks to everyone who didn't downrate XGELS for not being compatible, yet. To the ones who did: [insert swearword]!!
<br><br>
  THESE FEATURES ARE BROKEN IN 4.0
  * App drawer tabs and folders
  * L toggles are now removed
  * App drawer swipe up gesture
  * GS4.0 broke the icon glow effect, it's not an XGELS issue
<br>
  All of these bugs are not present in the current official rollout (Google Search 3.6.14). Therefore I do not advise updating your Google Search. Of course I'll work in fixing it.
