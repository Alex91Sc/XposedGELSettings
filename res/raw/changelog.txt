! XGELS is discontinued. Read <a href="http://bit.ly/1kpB3GF">here</a> why!
! Nonetheless I decided to push my local build which you can still use with <a href="http://bit.ly/1n025cA">G Now 3.3</a>.

! Added:
* Notification badges (require MissedIt!)
* Open app drawer from last closed position
* Gesture action - show recents
* Option to only allow double tap on wallpaper (reduces delay)
* Send debug logs (Settings menu)
* Don't show Google Play warning again

! Fixed:
* app dock not hiding after a while
* navigation bar buttons not changed after reboot
* not on default homescreen after reboot
* gesture need 1-2 minutes after reboot
* nasty flip animation when pulling down the quick settings panel
* navigation bar buttons not changed when notification/quicksettings bar is expanded
* fixed backup/restore on Samsung devices

! Misc:
* Auto kill launcher on preference changed
* Donate is now Premium, see my statement <a href="http://bit.ly/1hpMdwm">here</a>
